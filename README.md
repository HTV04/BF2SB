SmileBASIC 4 version: https://smilebasicsource.com/page?pid=1378

This is a tool that converts brainfuck code to SmileBASIC 3 code. It features a code minifier (which allows for indentation and comments for source code) and an optimizer, as well as optimization and indentation for the converted code. Three brainfuck programs are included in this project as examples: a hello world program, a cat program (displays input), and a program that displays square numbers. The project also includes a debug program for checking the bit width.
